# personalgame

This is my personal game. The changes I made to my script were changing the walk and jump speed. I do not know a ton about coding, so this was the part I was sure I knew how to change and it wouldn't blow up my game. I also thought that altering the speeds would make my game harder and more engaging. I faced a couple challenges during this project, several small ones that I was able to revise myslef, like losing some progress and forgetting my headphones, but there were a couple large ones. I wanted to make a respawn or game over function, but I had zero idea how to that myself, so I asked Mrs. Terkper, and she had quite a bit of trouble. she was able to figure everything out in the end. In my game, I am probably most proud of my character sprites, and the fact that everything has worked so far. I also really like the music I found for my project.
